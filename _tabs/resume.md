## Location:

China

## Position:

Datacenter technician, DevOps, Data analysis, Data engineering, Cybersecurity, Research assistant, DevOps, DevSecOps

## Summary:

Network and system administration, on-prem, cybersecurity, data engineering, machine learning, DevOps, data analytics. Focused on open-source solutions. I like the concept of a data-driven world and getting insights from data, enjoy building complex systems. Love learning new things and adding value to other people's lives.

## Projects:

#### On-premise GPU cluster
Designed and built on-premise multi-node multi-GPU hyper-converged cluster, including surrounding infrastructure, cybersecurity and helpdesk. 10GbE fiber optics in LACP bonds and 200G Nvidia InfiniBand. Proxmox VE, CEPH with RBD erasure coding pools, FreeIPA central authentication, LXC containers, Docker. The cluster is used for training deep learning models, and also for other tasks such as data engineering and data analysis. HCI was chosen to lower the total cost of ownership, and to increase flexibility and scalability. Increased flexibility of resource allocation allows more efficient hardware utilization.

#### Horizontal scaling
Rewriting single process CPU and GPU tasks code to use multiprocessing and multithreading to optimize compute load and shorten task execution time. Tasks range from text and audio signal data engineering to deep learning models inference.
