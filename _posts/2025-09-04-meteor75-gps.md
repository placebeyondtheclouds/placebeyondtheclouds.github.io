Added a GPS module to my Betafpv Meteor75 Pro to set up gps rescue.

## the process
- module `BE-112`, based on the `M10050` chip. 16.5x12.3x6 mm, 3 grams, 15mA@5v. no glonass (nobody cares). default 115200 baud. 
- soldered to UART4, restored the conformal coating afterwards
- when the module was mounted inside the canopy very close to the VTX antenna, I had zero satellites because of the interference from the VTX. despite GPS working on 1.5GHz and VTX transmitting on 5.8GHz, the harmonics from VTX signal are interfering with the GPS. I had to move the gps module to the front, away from the vtx antenna, to get GPS to work.
- total weight without battery: 36.0 grams
- Betaflight settings, throttle values are for a 550mAh battery (14.7g). also need to set the failsafe mode to a switch in the Modes tab:
  ```
  #given the angle mode is high on CH6
  rxfail 3 s 1500
  rxfail 5 s 2000

  set failsafe_delay = 15
  set failsafe_off_delay = 60
  set failsafe_throttle = 1100
  set failsafe_switch_mode = STAGE1
  set failsafe_throttle_low_delay = 300
  set failsafe_procedure = GPS-RESCUE
  set gps_ublox_use_galileo = ON
  set gps_set_home_point_once = ON
  set gps_rescue_alt_mode = CURRENT_ALT
  set gps_rescue_initial_climb = 5
  set gps_rescue_throttle_hover = 1463
  set gps_rescue_throttle_max = 1800
  set gps_rescue_min_sats = 5
  set gps_rescue_allow_arming_without_fix = ON

  save
  ```
