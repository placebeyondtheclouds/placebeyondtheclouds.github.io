I bricked one of the ESCs on the 1S Matrix AIO after unsuccessful melody write, probably because of [the bug](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/issues/14427) in the newest Betaflight. The configurator started saying "read failed" on it.Here's how I unbricked it.

## the process

- to stay on the safe side, downgraded Betaflight to 4.5.1
- follow the [tutorial](https://oscarliang.com/flash-blheli-c2-interface/)
- buy Arduino nano (15å…ƒ clone is okay too, but it must have the bootloader).
- download [BLHeliSuite](https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli)
- make the C2 interface by flashing the Adruino using BLHeliSuite
- use needles to connect the Adruino to the ESC pads
- connect a fully charged battery
- press read, then flash Blheli_S
- disconnect everything
- connect a fully charged battery, connect USB port to the computer
- connect-disconnect using [Betaflight configurator](https://app.betaflight.com/)
- connect using [ESC configurator](https://esc-configurator.com/)
- reset settings, write settings
- flash Bluejay one by one
- reset settings, write settings
- adjust the settings from before (especially motor direction), write settings
- write melody
- disconnect everything
- restore the conformal coating
- reflash Betaflight to the newest version, restore the config
