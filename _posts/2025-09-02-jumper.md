The original revision of the radio comes with JP4-in-1 multiprotocol internal module. It is possible to convert the radio to support ELRS by either replacing the internal module with the 1W ELRS module (but it has [a hardware bug](https://oscarliang.com/jumper-t-pro/#Hardware-Bug-in-the-Internal-ELRS-Version) that will brick it if firmware update were to go wrong) or the external module AION 2.4GHz ELRS TX (500mW). I went with the external module. It has a very flimsy antenna that is connected to its SMA-MMCX pigtail. So since the multiprotocol module uses 2.4GHz antenna, I decided to remove the internal module and connect the integrated antenna directly to the MMCX connector on the external module.
