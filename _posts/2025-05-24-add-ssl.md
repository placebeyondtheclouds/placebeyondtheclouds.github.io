Sometimes I need to access an HTTP webapp through HTTPS, for instance, when **testing** the app on another server and it needs microphone or camera access through a browser on my local machine. A simple universal solution would be to add a reverse proxy with a self-signed SSL cert (which could be replaced with a valid one later). The even simpler but more limited solution would be to use port forwarding:

```shell
socat TCP-LISTEN:8080,reuseaddr,fork TCP:remote-server:80
```

or using ssh tunnel if the service is not exposed to the network:

```shell
ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:80 user@remote-server
```

and access the remote app running on port 80 through `http://localhost:8080`, but this approach is limited to one machine and doesn't scale.

## the end result:

a bash script that can be put into a `Dockerfile` to add a reverse proxy with a self-signed SSL cert and WebSocket support (which is important for some webapps, like open-webui, or webapps based on `streamlit` framework).

## prerequisites:

an ubuntu/Debian system or container

## steps:

the script is largely based on my [script to fake internet connection for a Kindle](https://github.com/placebeyondtheclouds/my-shell-scripts/blob/main/kindle_fake_internet.sh) to make it connect to a WiFi without Internet access.

the script is here: [add_ssl.sh](https://github.com/placebeyondtheclouds/my-shell-scripts/blob/main/add_ssl.sh). it should be run like `./add_ssl.sh <webapp_port> <webapp_port_ssl> <webapp_name>`.
for instance, if put into a `Dockerfile`, it must be run before switching to a non-root user:

```dockerfile
COPY add_ssl.sh /usr/local/bin/add_ssl.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/add_ssl.sh
RUN /usr/local/bin/add_ssl.sh 3000 3443 my_webapp
```

also need to modify the rest of the container settings to expose the new port properly
