## what this is:

my notes on how I did it, and the research that I've done. corrections are welcome, especially with own experience or corrections on the legal side of things.

## what this is not:

- not an answer to the question of whether you should register your drone in China or not
- not a recommendation on what power output to set your TX to
- not a beginner's guide on how to build a drone


## the end result:

An FPV drone that fits the requirements for 轻型无人驾驶航空器 (lightweight drone) in China, while having secure communication channels (remote control, video feed, OSD data, telemetry) between the drone and the operator.
